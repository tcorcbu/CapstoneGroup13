                        Intro (Max & Eric):<br>
                        People are placed on a permanent spell<br>
                        Makin’ the invisible visible is our Sermon to tell<br><br>

                        Verse 1 (Max):<br>
                        Imagine that the government treats you like a criminal,<br>
                        Try walkin’ in their shoes you will feel like you're invisible<br>
                        You're passed on the street in the cold or the heat<br>
                        No one stops to give a crumb, they just label you a bum<br>
                        They don't know what lays inside, so they just toss you aside<br>
                        Ain't no individuality, society creates a new class of criminality<br>
                        Gotta think about the opportunities that we were given,<br>
                        It's not that many of these people aren't extremely driven<br>
                        We dehumanize, it's time we rationalize and realize <br>
                        All the damage that we've done to this population<br>
                        Gotta get rid of these stinkin’ laws and these regulations<br>
                        If I’m homeless they won't even hire me<br>
                        Time to recognize this is the fault of bourgeois society<br>
                        The government obeys the wishes of the upper class<br>
                        Not knowin’ what harm it's doin’ to those without cash<br>
                        If you look into their eyes you will realize<br>
                        The homeless, they don't come in one shape nor one size<br>
                        You think about the old man on the corner,<br>
                        But what about the mother who just can't afford to feed her daughter<br>
                        You think about the person begging for some money,<br>
                        But what about the veteran who fought all those years for his country?<br>
                        So next time you see somebody who needs a little guidance,<br>
                        Just think about these words, don't turn your back in silence<br><br>



                        Verse 2 (Eric):<br>
                        To continue the conversation<br>
                        From the Bean to across the nation<br>
                        Policies and actions must be addressed in administration<br>
                        It's more than the government to keep in consideration<br>
                        At an assembly not enough show dedication, avoid cooperation<br>
                        These are just some of the issues, legislations<br>
                        From the today's society to its foundation<br>
                        Wait for hours in line to get no accommodation<br>
                        Travel often but don't call it a vacation<br>
                        Chronic poverty forcin’ kids to forget about graduation<br>
                        Not enough resources allocated to education<br>
                        People who need healthcare, welfare, medication<br>
                        If you wanna see what we see here's a clarification<br>
                        When the streets are floodin’ with the poor<br>
                        Got no home, no shower, sleepin’ outdoor<br>
                        Our society views poverty as an eyesore<br>
                        Why does government choose to ignore<br>
                        Too Focused on war off shore<br>
                        People politicin’ policies need to restore<br>
                        Change is what they need to look for<br>
                        In order to take it all in one must explore<br>
                        We need more change, not nickels dimes, and quarters<br>
                        But government action and more orders<br>
                        They need help and more supporters<br>
                        The faces we saw, the stories we heard<br>
                        Not only the ones you see on the streets and the curb<br>
                        Why is this issue at the back like puzzle crossword<br>
                        In politics, this issue is invisible, make the intangible physical<br>
                        The situation is way too Critical<br>
                        If no one takes action, we'll need a miracle<br>
                        That happens rarely<br>
                        That's what scares me<br>
                        But capstone did prepare me<br>
                        And my group of the reality<br>
                        Taking things for granted, such as a cup of tea<br>
                        Or a home with a bed every night guaranteed<br>
                        Or at least how we know we have everything that we need<br>
                        Grateful for our lives and the fact that we breathe<br>
