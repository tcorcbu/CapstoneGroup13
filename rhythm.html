                        People are placed on a permant spell<br>
                        Makin the invisible visible is our Sermon to tell<br><br>

                        imagine that the government treats you like a criminal,<br>
                        try walkin in their shoes you will feel like you're invisible<br>
                        you're passed on the street in the cold or the heat<br>
                        no one stops to give a crumb they just label you a bum<br>
                        don't know what lays inside they just toss you aside<br>
                        ain't no individuality, society wants to make a class of criminality<br>
                        gotta think about the opportunities that you were given,<br>
                        it's not that many of these people aren't extremely driven<br>
                        cuz we dehumanize, it's time we rationalize and realize <br>
                        all the damage that we've done to this population<br>
                        gotta get rid of these laws and regulations<br>
                        truth is if im homeless they just won't hire me<br>
                        time to recognize that this is the fault of bourgeoise society<br>
                        the government obeys the wishes of the upper class<br>
                        not knowin what harm it's doin to those without cash<br>
                        cuz look into their eyes you will realize the homeless<br>
                        don't come in one shape nor one size<br>
                        you think about the old man on the corner,<br>
                        but what about the mother who just can't afford to feed her daughter<br>
                        you think about the person begging for some money,<br>
                        but what about the vet who fought years for his country?<br>
                        so next time you see somebody who needs some guidance, <br>
                        just think about these words, don't turn your back in silence<br>

                        To continue the conversation<br>
                        from the bean to across the nation<br>
                        Policies and actions  must be addressed  in administration<br>
                        It's more than  the government to keep in consideration<br>
                        At an assembly not enough show dedication ,  avoid cooperation, <br>
                        these are just some of the issues in throughout legislation<br>
                        From the today's  society to its foundation<br>
                        Wait for hours  in line to get no accommodation<br>
                        travel often but don't call it a vacation<br>
                        Chronic poverty forcin kids to forget bout graduation<br>
                        Not enough resources allocated to education<br>
                        People who need health care welfare, and medication<br>
                        If you wanna see what we see here's a clarification<br>


                        When the streets are floodin with the poor<br>
                        Got no home, no shower, sleepin outdoor<br>
                        Our society views  poverty an eyesore<br>
                        Why does government  choose to ignore<br>
                        To Focused on war off shore<br>
                        People politicin policies need to restore<br>
                        Change is what they need to look for<br>
                        In order to take it all in if one must: Explore<br>



                        We need more change, not nickels dimes, and quarters<br>
                        But government action and more orders<br>
                        They need help and more supporters<br>


                        The faces we saw, the stories we heard<br>
                        not only the ones you see on the streets and the curb<br>
                        Why is this issue  at the back like puzzle crossword<br>


                        in politics, this issue is invisible , make the intangible physical,<br> the sitiuation is way to Critical<br>
                        If no one takes action, we'll need Miracle<br>
                        That happens rarely,<br>
                        That's what scares me<br>
                        But capstone did prepare me<br>
                        And my group of the reality<br>
                        taking things for granted, such as cup of tea<br>
                        Or a home a with a bed every night guaranteed<br>
                        Or at least how we know we have everything that we need<br>
                        grateful for our lives and the fact that we breath<br>
